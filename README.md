Description:

SKEPSIS is a cardiovascular risk calculation program that was created in collaboration with a group of NEU students. It calculates cardiovascular risk based on the Framingham Risk Score and the Hellenic Risk Score. The patient can use SKEPSIS himself, upload the data needed from the laboratory tests and calculate his cardiovascular risk. With the use of SKEPSIS, the prevention of cardiovascular risk can increase and thus reduce the morbidity and mortality due to cardiovascular events which are the first cause of death worldwide.

Scope of Work:

1. Review SKEPSIS work to evaluate if it is possible to use PDF templates that can be parsed for data elements to automatically compute when a PDF is uploaded.
2. Use any publicly available data (e.g.: CDI) to evaluate CV risk related data patterns based on data Framingham and Hellenic (and metabolic syndrome) to provide prescriptive recommendations for potential patterns to watch (e.g.: If you are X and have Y, then, you could also get Z).
3. The project is open enough for the students to use AI/ML to come up with prescriptive recommendations within the scope of CV risk parameters (HDL/LDL, Diabetes, Smoking, Obesity indicators, etc.)

Additional Consideration: There is also a related project where another team is working on UX/Website project incorporating a new metabolic syndrome as part of the Cardiovascular risk. So, I suggest you also have cross-team collaboration with that team to avoid having the sponsor repeat information.
